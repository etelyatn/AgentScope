# AgentScope usage reference

The full reference for running and configuring AgentScope. For installation and a quick tour, see the [README](../README.md).

## Command line

```text
agentscope [OPTIONS]
agentscope inspect <rollout.jsonl|rollout.jsonl.zst>
```

| Option | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `--config <path>` | Config file (default: platform config directory) |
| `--codex-sessions <dir>` | Codex sessions root |
| `--claude-projects <dir>` | Claude Code projects root |
| `--claude-desktop <dir>` | Claude Desktop application-data directory |
| `--opencode-db <path>` | OpenCode database |
| `--omp-sessions <dir>` | OMP sessions root |
| `--pi-sessions <dir>` | Pi sessions root (native JSONL; extension subagents unsupported) |
| `--hermes-db <path>` | Hermes `state.db` |
| `--no-processes` | Disable process observation |
| `--no-color` | Disable color (`NO_COLOR` is also honored) |
| `--no-mouse` | Disable mouse capture |
| `--version`, `--help` | Print version or help |

The TUI needs an interactive terminal on both stdin and stdout. Minimum size is 60×20.

### `inspect`

The experimental `inspect` command prints a Codex transcript from an explicitly supplied JSONL (or archived `.jsonl.zst`) file without the TUI:

```bash
agentscope inspect path/to/session.jsonl
```

It escapes terminal controls and applies best-effort masking, reports malformed, incomplete, or over-1-MiB records with byte offsets, and may still print sensitive session content.

## Screens

### Roster

The roster groups sessions by project; a group heading shows its loaded member totals (`N sessions · tokens · cost`), and a child always renders under its parent in the parent's group. Each session is two lines: a status glyph, fold marker and bold display title with right-aligned `STATUS`, `SPEED`, `TOKENS` and `COST`, then a quiet line with the agent tag (`OMP`, `CDX`, `CLD`, `OC`, `HRM`, `PI`; `[OMP]` in no-color mode), model, thinking level and billing provider. Narrow terminals drop `COST`, then `SPEED`, then `TOKENS`; `STATUS` always stays, and there is no horizontal column scrolling. Children are folded by default (`▸ Title +N`).

From 150 columns the preview takes 45 columns beside the list. Its pinned header shows the tag, title, project/model/effort/provider, status and evidence, tokens with provenance, cost, speed, and a stacked token bar with a legend; `J`/`K` or the wheel scroll `CONTEXT`, `STARTED` and `LAST ACTIVITY`. The last-activity block is read in the background and shows the latest tool line and reply, or an explicit `…`, `no activity recorded`, `no reply in recent events` or `couldn't read latest activity`. Narrower than 150 columns, `Tab` swaps list and preview and `Esc` returns.

The roster loads the newest **50 top-level groups** at a time; children, forks, and compression continuations never consume a root slot. `m` (or `Enter` on a focused Load more row) reveals the next 50. A load is a frozen generation: new discoveries, deletions, and late parent edges appear only after an explicit refresh, which keeps the selected session where it can. **Search and filters cover only the loaded roots** (and any loaded children, whose matching parent stays visible); an unloaded session is never reported as absent.

### Inspector

The inspector opens at the newest event with follow mode on: a three-line header, then conversation rows with `▌ You`/`▌ Agent`, tool rows (`✓` completed, `✗` error, `…` pending, `?` unknown), persisted reasoning summaries and folded auxiliary calls. `Enter` expands a row in place with recorded argument, output and reasoning previews ending `recorded preview · v opens the source`; while following, appended events move to and expand the latest row. `o` opens a resolved child's transcript and `Esc` pops back.

Agent replies are rendered as Markdown in the inspector and in details: headings, emphasis, inline code and code blocks, lists and task lists, quotes, tables, rules, and links with their target shown after the text. Raw HTML is shown literally, never interpreted, and the text is sanitized and redacted before rendering. Prompts, reasoning and tool output stay as recorded, and `v` always shows the unrendered source record. With `NO_COLOR`, inline code keeps its backticks.

`d` opens event details: a badge header with time, relative age and `event N of M loaded`, `[`/`]` for the previous/next loaded event, and content beside `USAGE`/`COST`/`SOURCE` at 110 columns (stacked below). `i` opens session info: the same header and `TOKENS`, `COST`, `TIME & SPEED`, `CONTEXT`, `FAMILY` and `PROCESS` panels in two columns at 90 columns (stacked below), with `m` for older compactions and `Space` for summaries.

## Keys

| Screen | Keys |
|---|---|
| Roster | `j`/`k` move (and rest on explicit Load more rows), `g`/`G` first/last, `←`/`→` (`h`/`l`) collapse/expand (Left on a child selects its parent), `Space` show or hide a family's children, `Enter` open a session or load more on a focused Load more row, `m` load the next 50 roots, `/` search loaded roots, `f` filter, `s` sort (`S` reverse), `r` refresh, `p` process candidates, `?` help, `q` or `Ctrl+c` quit. On wide terminals `Tab` opens the inspector; on narrow ones it swaps list and preview. |
| Inspector | `j`/`k`/`g`/`G` move (`G`/`End` jumps to latest), `Enter` expand or collapse, `/` search loaded events, `n`/`N` next/previous match, `d` details, `i` session info, `o` open a resolved child, `v` source record, `D` diagnostics, `x` reveal or re-mask the selected record's source, `r` retry/refresh, `Esc` back (popping child navigation before the roster), `Shift+Tab` roster. |
| Details | `[`/`]` previous/next loaded event, `v` source, `D` diagnostics, `o` child, `Esc` back. |
| Session info | `m` older compactions, `Space` summaries. |

The help overlay (`?`) lists the main keys and the value, status and tool legend.

### Mouse

Capture is on by default and read-only. A click selects a row, a click on the marker expands it, a click on a Load more row loads that page, the wheel scrolls the list or the preview. Events that carry Shift are ignored, so Shift+drag (or your terminal's equivalent) still selects text. `--no-mouse` (or `mouse_enabled = false`) never enables capture and keeps every keyboard action. The terminal is restored on quit, `Ctrl+c`, setup failure and panic. Mouse clicks never act on monitored agents.

## Reading values

Compact views show `—` for unavailable values and `…` for values not read yet; `+` marks a partial total (a lower bound) and `~` an estimate or mtime-derived age; a failed read says `couldn't read`. Detail views spell Unknown/not recorded in words.

Status is a glyph, word and age, with its evidence in the preview and detail headers:

| Glyph | Status |
|---|---|
| `●` | active |
| `○` | recent |
| `!` | quiet |
| `▲` | stalled? (possibly stalled) |
| `✓` | complete |
| `✗` | failed |
| `×` | cancelled |
| `-` | unavailable |
| `?` | unknown |

Usage is labeled `Reported`, `Derived`, `Partial`, `Estimated`, or `Unknown`. Streamed requests are priced one by one with their own model; cost is an estimate and is `Unknown`, never `$0.00`, when it cannot be priced completely. A reported `$0` (e.g. a subscription) is shown as reported next to an API-equivalent estimate, never as free.

## Data locations

Each root resolves in this order: **CLI flag, then the provider's environment variable (where one exists), then `[providers.<harness>].root`/`db`, then the platform default**. Configured `extra_roots` are appended after the primary root.

| Harness | CLI | Environment | Config | Platform default |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Codex | `--codex-sessions` | `CODEX_HOME/sessions` | `[providers.codex].root` | `~/.codex/sessions` |
| Codex archive | — | `CODEX_HOME/archived_sessions` (derived) | `[providers.codex].archived_root` | `~/.codex/archived_sessions` (derived) |
| Claude Code | `--claude-projects` | `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR/projects` | `[providers.claude].root` | `~/.claude/projects` |
| Claude Desktop | `--claude-desktop` | — | `[providers.claude_desktop].root` / `extra_roots` | platform app-data `Claude` and `Claude-3p` directories |
| OpenCode | `--opencode-db` | `XDG_DATA_HOME/opencode/opencode.db` | `[providers.opencode].db` | `~/.local/share/opencode/opencode.db` |
| OMP | `--omp-sessions` | — | `[providers.omp].root` / `extra_roots` | `~/.omp/agent/sessions` |
| Pi | `--pi-sessions` | `PI_CODING_AGENT_DIR/sessions` | `[providers.pi].root` / `extra_roots` | `~/.pi/agent/sessions` |
| Hermes | `--hermes-db` | `HERMES_HOME/state.db` | `[providers.hermes].db`, else `.root` / `extra_roots` | `%LOCALAPPDATA%\hermes<suffix>\state.db` or `~/.hermes<suffix>/state.db` |

A configured Hermes home root additionally discovers `profiles/<name>/state.db`; `--hermes-db` names a single database. `HERMES_DATA_DIR_SUFFIX` is appended literally to the platform home name. A path named for both OMP and Pi (a CLI flag, config root, or extra root) is kept only when exactly one harness was given it through its CLI flag; if both or neither name it, neither harness reads it, and a startup note explains the conflict. Deriving the Codex archive from `CODEX_HOME` happens only when no custom sessions root is in use; an explicit `archived_root` always names the archive store.

## Configuration

The config file is `agentscope/config.toml` in the platform config directory, or the path given with `--config`:

| Platform | Default path |
|---|---|
| Windows | `%APPDATA%\agentscope\config.toml` |
| macOS | `~/Library/Application Support/agentscope/config.toml` |
| Linux | `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/agentscope/config.toml` or `~/.config/agentscope/config.toml` |

An unreadable explicit path is an error, while a missing default file is fine. The config file is never rewritten for you.

```toml
# Global keys must come before the first table: TOML assigns later keys to the
# table they follow.
native_api_reference_estimates = true   # label native Claude/Codex usage as a reference API estimate when no route is recorded
max_cached_sessions = 2000

[providers.codex]
root = "D:/stores/codex/sessions"       # CLI --codex-sessions wins over this
archived_root = "D:/stores/codex/archived_sessions"

[providers.hermes]
root = "D:/stores/hermes"               # a home: profiles/<name>/state.db is also read
```

Other keys and their defaults:

| Key | Default |
|---|---|
| `refresh_ms` | 2000 |
| `process_ms` | 5000 |
| `process_enabled` | true |
| `quiet_after_secs` | 300 |
| `stall_after_secs` | 900 (must exceed quiet) |
| `max_cached_sessions` | 2000 |
| `max_metadata_sources` | 100000 |
| `max_metadata_bytes` | 67108864 |
| `max_page_events` | 500 |
| `max_page_bytes` | 262144 |
| `max_record_bytes` | 1048576 |
| `dedup_ledger_entries` | 100000 |
| `dedup_ledger_bytes` | 8388608 |
| `refresh_busy_timeout_ms` | 2000 |
| `page_busy_timeout_ms` | 250 |
| `redaction` | true |
| `mouse_enabled` | true |
| `native_api_reference_estimates` | true |

Zero is rejected for every numeric limit. `--no-processes` and `--no-mouse` override config; `NO_COLOR` and `--no-color` disable color. Unknown keys are rejected. Removed keys fail with the replacement name instead of being guessed: `max_sessions` → `max_cached_sessions` and `[[pricing]].provider` → `billing_provider`.

### Pricing

Prices come from an offline catalog compiled into the binary; nothing is fetched at runtime. The catalog is keyed by billing route and exact model, and every amount it produces is an **API-equivalent estimate**, never billed spend. Only two recorded amounts are retained: a provider-reported API amount (`ReportedApi`; a reported zero stays reported and only a positive amount overrides the API-equivalent estimate) and a provider-saved estimate whose source is verified (`SavedCatalogEstimate`). An unverified saved amount, a subscription value, or a parent's quoted child cost is not counted as money.

Optional `[[pricing]]` entries replace the bundled card with the same exact `billing_provider` (the route that bills the model, e.g. `anthropic`, `openai`, `opencode`, `opencode-go`) and `model`; legs you omit stay unknown instead of inheriting bundled rates:

```toml
[[pricing]]
billing_provider = "anthropic"
model = "claude-sonnet-5-5"
as_of = "2026-10-01"
input_per_mtok = 2.0
output_per_mtok = 10.0
cache_read_per_mtok = 0.10
cache_write_5m_per_mtok = 2.5
cache_write_1h_per_mtok = 4.0
```

`[[pricing]]` requires `billing_provider`, `model`, `input_per_mtok`, and `output_per_mtok`; optional `effective_from`/`effective_until` bound a card's window, `cached_input_per_mtok` is an accepted alias for `cache_read_per_mtok` (the two may not disagree), and `cache_write_per_mtok` prices a write whose retention was not recorded. Separately reported reasoning tokens need `reasoning_per_mtok`; reasoning already counted inside output is never charged twice.

## Provider notes

**Claude Code and Claude Desktop.** Subagents (`<project>/<session>/subagents/**/agent-<id>.jsonl`) appear as children of their session with their own direct usage; workflow `journal.jsonl` and tool-result files are never listed as sessions. Claude Desktop Code sessions reuse the same project store: `--claude-desktop <dir>` (or `[providers.claude_desktop]` `root`/`extra_roots`) names the Desktop application-data directory whose allowlisted `claude-code-sessions/**/local_*.json` manifests and Cowork project roots are read; without it the platform defaults are used when present. Only those stores are opened: credentials, renderer caches, session audit logs and VM bundles are not read, and no local chat history is reconstructed. Sessions a Desktop manifest marks released are hidden by default behind the filter panel's "Include released sessions" row and are never deleted.

**OMP (oh-my-pi).** Sessions (`<root>/<working-directory bucket>/<timestamp>_<id>.jsonl`) and their artifact-tree subagents (`<session>/<agent>.jsonl`, nested to any supported depth) are read from `--omp-sessions` (or `[providers.omp]` `root`/`extra_roots`). A child is linked from the artifact directory shape plus the header evidence, a fork (`parentSession` without `continuationOf`) stays its own root, and a continuation chain is one logical session whose segments are read together. Lifetime usage counts every uniquely *owned* model call across all recorded branches; copies a fork or continuation repeats are never charged again, and a parent's `task` result that quotes a child's cost is not added to the parent. Current model, effort and prompt occupancy follow the recorded active branch; whole-request speed uses the recorded request duration. OMP persists no usage for a compaction's summarization call, so **compaction cost is Unknown**. Only the sessions tree is opened: credential, configuration, history, model and statistics stores, blob directories and arbitrary embedded paths are never read, and `.jsonl.gz` archives are reported as unsupported.

## Performance bounds

Discovery, hydration, transcript indexing, and count scans are sliced at **256 records, 8 MiB of expanded bytes, and a 100 ms scheduling target** (the time limit is checked between units of work, so one huge record can exceed it); discovery probes a 4 KiB head (header line up to 256 KiB) and a 32 KiB tail per source. A transcript/details page is at most 500 events and 256 KiB, a record 1 MiB, the loaded transcript 20,000 events with at most 16 pending loads, and the per-source ownership/dedup ledger is capped by the configured entries/bytes. A session's canonical identity is `(harness, native ID, source)`; a compressed or archived physical copy is a locator on that identity, so one logical rollout is one row and a moved copy is not a second session. Metadata ceilings print `Discovery limited`/per-harness warnings instead of pretending the roster ended.
